I'm a computational (and recently experimental) neuroscience PhD student at Imperial College London with <a href = 'https://cclopath.bg-research.cc.ic.ac.uk/'>Claudia Clopath</a> and <a href = 'https://beneuro.ic.ac.uk/'>Juan √Ålvaro Gallego</a>.  My research focuses on modelling and analyzing neural population dynamics in the motor cortex to understand how we learn different motor skills. 

Previously, I did my Master's in Bioinformatics & Theoretical Systems Biology at Imperial and my undergraduate degree in Biology (with a Computer Science minor) at Pomona College in the US. Apart from research, I'm passionate about making science and technology more accessible to the general public.
